# Detailed Repository Guide

This document gives a more detailed map of the repository and the Python package. It is intended for future work sessions where the first step is understanding where reusable logic lives.

## Project Purpose

The repository reimplements and extends experiments around two related research projects:

- "Deep Networks Learn Features from Local Discontinuities in the Label Function"
- "Layers as Lenses: A Narrative of Feature Learning in Deep Networks"

The central synthetic data setting is a complete orthogonal balanced oblique decision tree (COB-ODT). Current work includes both DLGN-SF baselines and ReLU MLP analysis on the same ODT data.

## Top-Level Directories

- `src/layer_lenses/` contains stable importable code.
- `notebooks/` contains exploratory and analysis notebooks.
- `notebooks/old_notebooks/` contains legacy reference notebooks and paper sources. Treat these as read-only unless explicitly asked otherwise.
- `notes/` contains project specifications, reproducibility records, paper-vs-notebook mismatch decisions, and session logs.
- `tests/` contains lightweight validation and regression tests.
- `results/` is the intended output root for generated run artifacts.

## Python Package Overview

### `src/first_experiment/__init__.py`

Backward-compatibility shim for artifacts serialized before the package rename.
It forwards old module paths like `first_experiment.relu_mlp` to `layer_lenses.relu_mlp`
so legacy pickle files can still be loaded.

### `src/layer_lenses/odt.py`

- `COBODTTree`: dataclass containing ODT internal hyperplanes, biases, and leaf labels.
- `_sample_unit_sphere`: samples input points uniformly from the unit sphere by normalizing Gaussian vectors.
- `_sample_orthonormal_vectors`: samples mutually orthonormal ODT decision vectors using QR.

## Development Conventions

- Keep stable reusable code in `src/layer_lenses/`.
- Keep notebooks exploratory; migrate repeated logic into `src/layer_lenses/`.
- Preserve seeds explicitly.
- Save generated artifacts under `results/`.
- Treat old notebooks and source papers as reference material, not as editable implementation targets.
- Prefer paper details over notebook behavior when sources conflict, and record decisions in `notes/paper_mismatches.md` or `notes/reproducibility_log.md`.
